Tomorrow is Friday, which means your weekly retrospective meeting, AKA, _Retro_ is right around the corner.

Every team does Retro differently and opinions about its usefulness vary. But the goal is universal: by reflecting on what you did this week, you can do _even better_ next week.

At Devpost, we&#39;ve experimented with a few different ways to do Retro. One way that worked well for us in the past was a _5 step, all hands Retro_. Since our whole team was moving towards a common goal, we involved everyone, not just the devs. Additionally, we asked that everyone arrived prepared. Here&#39;s how we did it:

**0.** First, we appoint a leader to run Retro. It&#39;s a rotating role and it&#39;s that person&#39;s job to keep us on track.

**1.** We go around the room and discuss what each of us did this week. This isn&#39;t a deep dive, it&#39;s a quick 1&ndash;2 minute summary of what our goals were and the progress we made.

We don&#39;t point fingers or shame people for a lack of progress. We&#39;re just stating the facts and identifying where we need help.

**2.** Each of us highlights 3 positives and a negative. The positives can be things we&#39;re proud of. Problems we solved. Teammates who helped us out. Team acheivements. Anything really.

Our negative, or _delta_, is an area where we fell short as a team and an opportunity for improvement. Deltas are not people. We like to write down our deltas on sticky notes and put them on a whiteboard to make them visual.

**3.** The Retro leader reviews the list of deltas, tabling anything that isn&#39;t actionable. Next, we have a brief discussion about how we could address each issue and then we vote on them. Everyone gets 3 votes, which we can use as we see fit.

**4.** After the vote, we define an action item and a lead for each of the top 3 deltas. Leads will work toward and present their progress at the next retro.

**Note:** This process works well if you can hold leads accountable, take meeting minutes, and give them enough time to work on their action items. If you&#39;re running at 120% every day, every week, then this process might not work for you.

These 5 steps helped us make changes in our business, culture, product, and mood. Whether you adapt it for your team&#39;s needs or follow another process, I hope you&#39;ll push yourself to be better every week.
