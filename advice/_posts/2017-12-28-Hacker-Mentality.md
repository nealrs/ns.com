As you prepare your mind, body, and spirit for 2018, consider this: In the 1880s, American homesteaders used [barbed wire fences to carry telephone signals](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/barbed-wire-telephone-lines-homesteaders-prairie-america-history), because telephone companies didn't think it was cost effective to run cable in rural areas.

Those homesteaders personified the hacker mentality. They identified a problem, found a solution, and then implemented it at the community level.

Today phones are a given, but we still like to test our limits. An ISP in the UK recently demonstrated that it could [transmit ADSL signals over wet string](http://www.revk.uk/2017/12/its-official-adsl-works-over-wet-string.html)! Why? Well, _why not_?

Step into the new year with your own hacker mentality. When you see a loose thread, pull on it and find out where it takes you!
