If you haven't watched the [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81035279) or [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/movie/fyre-fraud-e47078f3-1c0e-49a8-9da9-c571a7a20fec) documentaries about the Fyre Festival yet, you're missing out on the craziest startup drama of all time.

The original concept for Fyre was a marketplace for booking talent, like celebrities & musicians. The origin story? Founder Billy McFarland tries to book Ja Rule for a party, realizes the booking industry is broken, and resolves to change it.

It's not a bad idea either. Certainly no worse than an app for hailing taxis, because "finding a cab in San Francisco is broken."

So, Billy parlays his good idea into a startup, raises funds, hires a team of devs to turn it into a working product, and seeks out creative ways to market and launch it, including the ill-fated music festival.

Obviously, things went from interesting marketing stunt to _full-blown dumpster fyre_ pretty quickly. But if you look beyond the scam, Billy's real failure&mdash;in my opinion&mdash;is that he never validated Fyre's product/market fit.

Until you _know_ that your customers, and not just investors, want & value your product, you don't need to spend heavily in marketing or PR.

**Bottom line**: Don't be like Billy. Focus on finding your product/market fit first and then look for innovative ways to reach customers. 

Also, and I hope this isn't news to you: don't lie, scam, or abuse people's trust.
