At ad agencies, _Art Directors_ aren't actually director level employees. In banking, practically everyone is a _VP_, _SVP_, _EVP_, or _GVP_. Sometimes _Business Development_ is a sales job and somtimes it's about partnerships. And of course, anyone can call themselves a _founder_.

Objectively speaking, titles aren't a good indicator of capability or responsibility.

But employers aren't objective and they will use _your_ past titles to determine if you've got enough experience for a job & how much to pay you.

Bottom line â†’ make your title work for you:

**1.** Ask or negotiate for an accurate title that signals to future employers what you do. "Chief Hacker" sounds cute, but it's a lot harder to explain in a cover letter than "Lead Software Developer."

**2.** As your responsibilities change and you gain experience, you'll expect and ask for a raise. Expect and ask for an updated title too. In many organizations, compensation is tied to a title. Going from a Level 2 to Level 3 Engineer could open up a whole new salary range for you.

**3.** Don't be a slave to your title. Even if you're Level 4 Software Engineer today at company X, you might be a Level 3 at company Y. Every company sets titles & responsibilities differently.
