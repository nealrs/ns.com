Developers, and technologists in general, are often portrayed in media as oblivious bros or socially awkward, hubristic savants.

Need examples? 

- Newman's character in _Jurassic Park_ is a programmer named Nedry, (I mean, come on!), who acts holier than thou and gets eaten by a dinosaur. 
- Boris Grishenko, _GoldenEye_'s "invincible" hacker meets his end in an explosion of liquid Nitrogen. 
- Almost every character on _Silicon Valley_ is clueless about the consequences of their actions.

And while that may not represent or reflect **you**, it wouldn't hurt to express some empathy with [coworkers](http://danielwestheide.com/blog/2017/01/16/the-empathic-programmer.html), [customers](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3567-a-refresher-course-in-empathy), and during [product development](https://thenewstack.io/empathy-secret-sauce-good-software-development/). 

Remember, working in commercial software is about solving _other people's_ problems, not just your own.
