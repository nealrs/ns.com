You can fix broken code. You can fix a broken copy machine. You can even fix a broken process. But you just can't fix a company's culture by yourself.

Why? Because no _one_ person controls it. Everybody you work with&mdash;the CEO, Directors, employees, interns, HR, managers, and your colleagues&mdash;is inherently part of it. Culture isn't about parties, it's the personality of the organization: what they value and how they operate.

As an employee, you can provide feedback &amp; advocate for tactical improvements in the hiring process or a zero tolerance harassment policy, but these are mostly reactionary measures.

**What does this mean for your job hunt? You have to learn everything you can about a company before you apply, during your interviews, and before accepting an offer.**

Talk to current and past employees and construct a picture of the working environment. Ask employees _open-ended questions_ about how they would describe the culture and how they think it could be improved.

It takes time, but finding a team and company culture that will support you is worth way more than a few extra bucks.
