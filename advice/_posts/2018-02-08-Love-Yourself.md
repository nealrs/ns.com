Valentine's Day isn't about roses, chocolate, or candlelit dinners. It's about celebrating _love_. And the most important love of all, is the love you give yourself.

I'm talking about self-care. If you don't feel ðŸ’¯, you can't give ðŸ’¯ at work or at home.

Here are a few things that help our team find the love within:

- Cooking something delicious (Richard)
- Taking a walk without headphones (Robin)
- Going to a kickboxing class (Stef)
- Re-reading a great book (Brandon)
- _git stash && shutdown -r now_ (Matt)
- Dance-walking home to Tina Turner records (OK, this one's mine)
- Volunteering (Velizar)

Whatever you do, relax, reflect, and accept yourself.

To quote the immortal Brian May:

>_"I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way. Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day&hellip;Keep yourself alive!"_
