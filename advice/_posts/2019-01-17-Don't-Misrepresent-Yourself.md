**Pro-tip**: If you claim to be an expert at something on your résumé, you'd better be able to back it up in an interview.

Twice now, I've interviewed developers who, _on paper_, were GraphQL experts with contributions to fancy looking GraphQL projects on GitHub.

They talked a good game, but once I asked them a few questions about the advantages vs. a traditional RDBMS or to draw out a simple graph network - they totally biffed it.

It was clear their skills were far from what they had claimed. That's game over in my book.

It's 100% OK to reach and apply to jobs you might not be 100% qualified for / are outside your area of expertise. It's _not OK_ to misrepresent your capabilities or experience.

You don't need to memorize _Hello World_ for every language on your résumé, just keep in mind that everything on it is fair game for interviewers.
