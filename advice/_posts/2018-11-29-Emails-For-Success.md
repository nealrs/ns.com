Whether you work in marketing, accounting, development, or operations, you're a representative for your company. 

And when you meet people at conferences, online, at a coffee shop, or anywhere else in the world, you may find yourself in a situation where a person _X_ needs help with issue _Y_, because of _Z_: 

- *An acquaintance* wants to *know more about your product & pricing* and could become a *new client*.
- *Old classmate* wants you to *refer him to HR* and could be a *great hire*.
- *Client* alerts you about a service outage, which could lead to *lost revenue* unless you *inform the SRE team*. 

Relax. **You don't have to solve each issue yourself. Just route them to the appropriate people on your team**. 

First, send a quick _heads up_ Slack / text to your target team mate, confirming that they are the right person to handle this issue. This is important because all intros should be [double opt-in](https://avc.com/2009/11/the-double-optin-introduction/).

Once confirmed, send a short email that explicitly calls out _X_, _Y_, and _Z_:

**subject:** BigCo &lt;&gt; FooTech<br>
**to:** jon@foo.tech, leticia@big.co

_Leticia, please meet my colleague Jon, who's in charge of Sales. He can tell you all about our product and how we can help you promote BigCo's content to a broader audience._

_Jon, Leticia is a classmate from NYU and the Content Lead at BigCo. She heard about us through the ReCode article._

Easy, right? 3&ndash;4 sentences and an informative subject line is all it takes. 5 minutes, tops. I promise.
