As a software developer, the most common workplace injuries you'll face are Carpal Tunnel Syndrome & Tendonitis. The cause? Probably too much tippy-tapping on your keyword whilst ignoring [basic ergonomics](https://uhs.princeton.edu/health-resources/ergonomics-computer-use#workstation).

Then there are the freak accidents, like tumbling down a stairwell, tripping on an extension cord, or getting electrocuted by a bad benchtop power supply.

Don't freak out or encase yourself in bubble wrap though. You can avoid a lot of workplace injuries by paying attention, not taking undue risks, wearing proper safety equipment, and holding on to those handrails.

But if something _does_ happen and you do get injured **on the job**, you are likely entitled to [workers' compensation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Workers%27_compensation), which will help you fund your recovery. This isn't just a neat perk offered by progressive employers, it's the law pretty much everywhere [except Texas](https://twc.texas.gov/news/efte/workers_compensation.html).

Since laws vary, you'll have to research your own situation. Pro tip: HR usually has all this information at the ready. Because, lawyers.

And if you're interning, there's good news for you too. Paid or unpaid, [most interns do qualify](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/are-interns-covered-under-workers-compensation-insurance-3515273) for some form of worker's comp. So, whether you spill hot coffee on yourself or slip on a stack of TPS reports&mdash;your injury matters and should be taken seriously.
