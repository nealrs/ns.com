>_Meetings, where minutes are taken and hours are lost._

Yep, meetings are awful sometimes. But no developer is an island. At some point you'll need to get, deliver, or confirm information, in real-time, within a one-to-many or many-to-many environment. That's what meetings are for.

While everyone has their own [meeting methodology](https://www.getminute.com/how-to-run-a-meeting-like-google-apple-amazon-and-facebook/), it all kind of boils down to this: **meetings are expensive and should deliver a positive ROI**.

Every time you increase the number of attendees, go over your scheduled time, come late / unprepared, leave without a firm decision, or schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss something you couldn't address today, you're losing money.

So, how do you make meetings cheaper? 

- Send out an agenda beforehand and stick to it. 
- Ensure that every meeting is run by a single person. 
- Make sure your meeting has a clear goal. 
- Only invite people who can give relevant input or make decisions.

Cheap meetings lead to better work, fewer follow-ups, and less employee dread. Give it a try and tell us how it goes!
