Job interviews are supposed to be a two way street, not cop show style interrogations. So, during the last 10 minutes of your call or meeting, take the opportunity to ask a few questions and learn more about the company, the role, and the team.

But, be mindful of your audience. A recruiter probably can't tell you much about the stack, but they _can_ tell you about how the team is organized, benefits, next steps in the hiring process, and ballpark salary.

Once you get past HR and start speaking to hiring managers & potential colleagues, you can ask much more probing questions. Here are a few of my favorites:

- How do you measure success for this role? 

☝️_This speaks to how you'll be evaluated, what the company values most, and what you need to focus on to get promoted._
 
- Tell me about a recent failure and how your team recovered. 

☝️_Flip the script and look at how the organization deals with failure & how open they are about it. If they dodge you, press them a little. Nobody is perfect, but we can all improve._

- Can you tell me about your revenue, profitability, and growth plans? 

☝️_Growth is everybody's problem!_
