School’s back in session, which means you’re juggling classes, clubs, and a rapidly approaching cuffing season. And unless you’ve got deep pockets or generous parents, you’ve got to make some money too.

Your full-time job is being a student, but a part time gig is a no brainer. Everyone at Devpost worked their way through school. We’ve washed dishes, TA’d classes, designed books, started a record label, shelved books at the library, and given campus tours. 

_BTW, if you’re interested in working for us part-time, on-campus, this fall & spring, [we're hiring campus reps at a bunch of schools](https://careers.jobscore.com/careers/devpost/jobs/student-ambassadors-based-in-multiple-cities-cuDAPwifOr56kCeMg-44q7?ref=rss&sid=68). It’s a real, paying gig._

The challenge with any part-time job is balancing it with your course load and all the other balls you’ve got in the air. 

**Here are a few tips that helped us keep it together:**

- Timebox and then seek help. Give every paper and problem set your all&mdash;for a defined period of time and then **go get help**. There’s no point wasting 10 hours on an assignment when 20 minutes with a TA can clear it up.
- A lot of campus jobs, like working at the library, come with major downtime. Use that time to do your homework. But ask if it’s OK first.
- Take some time off every week. Go to the library, play some ultimate, or just nap it out. College is supposed to be fun too.
- Split up group projects, complete your section, ask a teammate to review it, and do the same for them. I swear it’ll go faster than a big group discussion.
- This may be an unpopular suggestion, but schedule your classes in the morning. It’ll give you a few extra hours every day and it gives you all arvo and early evening for your job & extracurriculars
- Check if your school records lectures and if you can download them as podcasts. This works really well for classes without much boardwork. Pro tip: listen to them at 2&ndash;3x.
