From 2007&ndash;2018, I was a 'side project guy.' I ran a podcast, wrote 3 different newsletters, did mockups for every possible idea I had, started a gamedev project, started a educational video series, coded every night until 3 am, and worshipped at the altar of Product Hunt.

But 12 years later, I'm exhausted. And I have to ask myself, "Was it worth it? Should I continue?"

**Financially**, the answer is definitively _no_. If anything, I've probably spent upwards of $5,000 on Twilio / AWS / Heroku / Dreamhost / and other software & fees. üëé

**Socially**, I think it was worth it. I got to work with my best bud from college on a podcast for 7 years. I collaborated with a whole crew of kids in Australia on an interactive fiction project that bled into the real world. And I have expanded my network quite a bit. I got some kudos on HN / PH and I do get some recognition as _Devpost Neal_. üëç

Then again, many of my side projects were solo ventures and they required a lot of time. When I was single, it was easy to dedicate an entire weekend to learning about D3 or writing video scripts. It was stimulating, but removed me from socializing entirely. üëé

In terms of **personal development**, my side projects were huge for me. Basically everything I know about modern development came from my side projects. Prior to 2010, I had a pretty janky understanding of the LAMP stack, and I 'deployed' code via FTP. 

This week alone, I built an Alexa Skill in Node, refactored an ETL written in Python, and wrote an Electron desktop app to scrape data from an API-less platform. üëç

My **health** suffers a lot when I get invested in a side project. If it involves code, I'll quickly fall into deep work mode and before you know it, 15 hours will have gone by without food, breaks, or communication with the outside world. I get totally caught up. üëé 

It's also hard to balance **quality** and **consistency**. With newsletters & podcasts, I tried to produce something amazing every week, Because the key to audience development is consistency. 

But, if you back yourself into a corner and say "I'm going to produce 2 videos a week" &mdash; each of which takes literally 30 man hours to script, shoot, edit, and distribute &mdash; you won't be able to maintain the quality and burnout is inevitable. üëé

Tallying it up, I don't think I can be a side project guy anymore. Personal development & networking don't outweigh the costs to my health, wallet, and personal relationships.

That said, I don't want to stop learning and exploring new things. So, I'm going to focus on one or two projects, timebox my efforts so they fit around my other obligations, refuse to commit to a strict delivery schedule, and most importantly, make sure to check that I'm always having fun.

BTW, I do have fun writing this newsletter :)
