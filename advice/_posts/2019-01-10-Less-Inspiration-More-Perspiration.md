Our first newsletter of the year is usually super _rah rah_ and inspirational. Imma skip all that:

**New Year's → New budgets → New jobs**

The coffers are full and hiring managers want to fill out their teams fast.

Make a list of companies you want to work with, find recruiters at each of those companies, and email them a note introducing yourself. 3 emails a day is a good goal.

**Somewhat happily employed**

In 2018 you were an **X**, who wrote code to do **Y**, and achieved **Z**.

In 2019, you're still an **X** and chances are, your product & code still do **Y**. If you do everything the same for another 365 days, **Z** won’t change either.

Shake things up by establishing some _S.M.A.R.T_ new goals (specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound).

You don’t have to plan out the whole year, but you can set goals for this week, month, and quarter.

**Eager to make a change**

Establishing new habits and breaking old ones is hard. It takes around 2 months to retrain your brain.

Start small, work towards achievable milestones, and track your progress. You’re more likely to follow through and less likely to rage quit.

**Autodidacts & bounty hunters**
