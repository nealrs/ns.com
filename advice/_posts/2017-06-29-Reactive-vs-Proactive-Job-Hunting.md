There are two ways to look for a job. You can be _reactive_, waiting for recruiters to find you. Or you can be _proactive_, seeking out opportunities and controlling your own destiny.

The reactive approach can be compelling, because there are lots of email-happy recruiters lurking out there. But, it's unlikely that you're going to find a good fit or fulfilling work (our mission!), from this kind of shotgun tactic.
