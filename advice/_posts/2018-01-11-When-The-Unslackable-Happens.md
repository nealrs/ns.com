description: "How resilient is your company to a major service outage?"
---

On Tuesday, Slack went down and at first, we made all the [usual jokes](https://twitter.com/thatswattsup/status/950810027077480448). But it got us thinking: how resilient is your company to a major service outage?

* Can you still do your work and push code if s3, Azure, Rackspace, or EngineYard goes down?
* If your DNS provider gets DDoS'd, do you have a backup DNS provider?
* Are you keeping logs of all user activity? (without leaking PII)
* Are you logging your errors? Are they easily searchable?
* Do you have database redundancy, and do you test your backups?
* For remote teams, what is your default backup communications channel?

If you're unsure, ask your team!
