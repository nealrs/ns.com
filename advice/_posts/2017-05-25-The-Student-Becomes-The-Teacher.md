Pomp. Circumstance. Tassels. Mortarboards. Congratulations class of 2017, you did it!

Now, before you get back to hate-reading Medium pieces about student debt and choosing between avocado toast & buying a house&mdash;remember this:

In school teachers _push_ education with their syllabi and well-crafted lesson plans. From here on out though, you'll have to _pull_ information from different sources, **verify its validity**, and interpret it yourself.

You're the only one who can make you smarter now. (hint: go to a [hackathon](https://devpost.com/hackathons)!)
