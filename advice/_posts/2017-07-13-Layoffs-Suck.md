Last week SoundCloud laid off hundreds of engineers & staff around the world. And they're not alone. Layoffs affecting engineers are increasingly common. 

It's not just "software eating the world" either. Plenty of things outside your control&mdash;bad business decisions, lack of funding, poor scale, and redundancy&mdash;can cost you your job.

I got laid off once and it felt _awful_, like the world had singled me out. But I recovered and so will you.

**Here's how I got through my layoff**

**1.** I talked to people (my family, my girlfriend, my old co-workers) and felt all my feels.

**2.** I looked in the mirror and reminded myself that this was temporary and not my fault. Things happen, but I'm great.

**3.** I tuned up my résumé and LinkedIn profile by focusing on my _accomplishments_.

**4.** I filed for unemployment insurance. It wasn't a ton of money, but it helped me pay the bills while I searched for my next gig. Plus, I earned it!

**5.** I leveraged my network to find new opportunities, including freelancing assignments. Old roomates, crazy uncles, frenemies&mdash;your network is larger than you think.

**6.** I read lots of books, went to a few hackathons, and hit the gym. Wallowing in self-pity and binge watching _House of Cards_ is not a good look.

Layoffs happen. Don't let it prevent you from living your best life. Eventually, you'll find a new job. But, you'll never recover the time you spent worrying about it.
