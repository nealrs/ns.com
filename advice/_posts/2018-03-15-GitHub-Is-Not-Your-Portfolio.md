Real talk: most HR reps and hiring managers aren't interested in your GitHub profile. Unless your code is well documented, comes with tests, has great instructions, or is live online, don't expect anyone to clone it or try it out.

What will interest folks is a portfolio that demonstrates your best work and entices them to learn more about you. Here's what you have to do:

- Identify 3-5 projects that are relevant to _this_ particular job. A few poigant examples are better than a million half baked ideas.
- Focus on the story behind your code: _what_ you built, _why_ you built it, _how_ you built it, the _challenges_ you overcame, the _accomplishments_ you're proud of, and what you _learned_.
- You don't need to write a lot, just be clear. Imagine the reader skimming over each project in 1-2 minutes.
- Don't just tell, _show_. Use your Devpost portfolio ([here's mine](http://devpost.com/nealrs)) to highlight your top 4 projects. It supports markdown, image uploads, gifs, YouTube embeds, social links, and has great SEO. Why rebuild the portfolio when we've already done the work for you?
- Include a link to your portfolio in your resume, explictly call it out in your cover letter, and on your personal website. Unmentioned portfolios go unseen.
