Instead of binging on trash TV this weekend, freshen up your job search:

**1.** Write down your professional accomplishments from the last year, it'll make updating your résumé _much_ easier.

**2.** Make sure all the links work in your online portfolio. Heroku gears go to sleep, ngrok tunnels don't last forever, and you know, node dependencies&hellip;

**3.** [Email someone you'd like to meet](http://www.businessinsider.com/ex-googler-turned-ceo-asks-every-employee-to-cold-email-their-idol-2016-3). Actually, email two a week. Your network is just as important as your résumé.

**4.** Got a stack of business cards lying around from meetups &amp; interviews? Send them all a quick note and ask how they are doing / tell them what you've been up to. It'll only take a few minutes and might heat up a cold lead.
