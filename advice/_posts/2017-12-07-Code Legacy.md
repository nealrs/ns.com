In software development, _legacy_ comes with a negative connotation. Legacy software is old. It's a chore to work with. And to many developers, code doesn't just age, it rots, requiring regular replacement.

But what if your code has a legacy worth remembering? Like a cryptic [easter egg](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/405783/why-does-man-print-gimme-gimme-gimme-at-0030)? An [end-of-days](https://mailchi.mp/devpost/www.wikiwand.com/en/Year_2000_problem) panic? Or is a [cultural touchstone](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2017/10/06/aol_will_shut_down_aim_on_dec_15.html) for modern communication?

In today's Agile world, there's no point getting sentimental about code. There's a 50% chance you'll refactor it within a year. Instead, be sentimental about what it _enabled_.

You write code to build products. And those products exist to help real people. That's a legacy you should be proud of!
