Whether you meet someone at a job interview, career fair, or a coffee chat, following up isn't just a good idea&mdash;[it's a requirement](https://devpost.com/thecommit/video-following-up-isn-t-optional)!

Within 24 hours, write a short, 2&ndash;3 sentence email saying thanks for your time, highlighting something you enjoyed from your meeting, and that you look forward to doing, talking, learning, or hearing more about X soon.

That's literally all it takes. **Do not flake on this.**
