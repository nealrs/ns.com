I got this email from my building's Google group and I have to share it with you:

<p class="center"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/J2R8PRQ.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/J2R8PRQ.png" class="inlineimg"></a></p>

This is one of the best emails I've ever read. MJ will probably have 10 interviews lined up by tomorrow and 3 new gigs by Monday. Let's break this down and see what you can incorporate into your own cover letters & emails:

In her first two sentences, MJ establishes that she's looking for babysitting / nanny work on weekdays & evenings and that she's a local, intelligent, and that she has experience working in a service business.

BTW, my "building" is actually 12, 14 story buildings with over 1,000 apartments. 50% of those apartments contain families with at least 1 child. MJ is targeting a large, relevant audience with addressable needs.

Next, MJ lays out her 6 years of babysitting & nanny experience and identifies specific tasks she can do (pickups / dropoffs / errands) which are all standard requests in our neighborhood.

MJ also highlights additional ways she can care for and contribute to a child's development. She can teach them how to swim. She can keep them safe. She can feed them. She can entertain them. And she's creative. These "pot-sweeteners" aren't necessities, but they do make her stand out from the competition.

Finally, MJ reinforces two key characteristics (reliability & responsibility) that every nanny needs to have and closes with pricing & contact information.

I love everything about this email and hope you see how six sentences is all it takes to get people to notice you. It doesn't matter if you're a nanny or a Machine Learning engineer or a serial entrepreneur, the key to finding your next opportunity is communication.

**P.S.** Perhaps the _most_ effective part of MJ's email is that no other teenager in the building has ever done this before. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. So, shoot your shot!
