Getting a job isn't easy, especially in December when your inbox has more Out-of-Office responses than actual emails. But don't fret, because your persistence will pay off!

Right now hiring managers are planning for 2018. So it's a great time to lay some groundwork. Reach out to contacts, old & new, and mention that you're looking for positions in Q1. Ask them about upcoming projects they may need help with. Be helpful and establish yourself in their minds.

If you've got a lighter workload than usual, skill up by entering a [hackathon](http://devpost.com/hackathons) or taking an online class. Why wait to try out that new framework?

And if you're not 100% sure what you want to do next, figure it out with [Devpost Jobs](https://devpost.com/jobs).
