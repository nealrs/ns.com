Whether it's an asinine and unrealistic demand ("invert this binary tree") or the terrifying prospect of being judged on the spot&mdash;technical interviews aren't very popular amongst job hunters.

But here's the deal: you won't get a job in software development without an assessment of your programming / problem solving skills. Engineering managers don't just hand out offers because they like the cut of your jib.

So, instead of worrying, [prepare yourself with this episode of The Commit](https://devpost.com/thecommit/video-how-to-ace-your-technical-interviews) featuring Metric Collective CTO Kevin Dolan. You'll learn about the three most common types of interview questions (quiz, experience, hypothetical) and how to approach them.

And if you've got time, try solving the [battleship interview question](https://devpost.com/thecommit/video-how-to-solve-the-battleship-interview-question).
