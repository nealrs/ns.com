Headed home for the holidays? Prepare for unavoidable questions like "Can you fix my computer / phone / toaster?", "Should I buy a Bitcoin?", and "What does Switzerland have to do with my Internet?"

And then, once you've finished rolling your eyes, teach your family how to use a [password manager](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-password-managers,review-3785.html), [two-factor authentication](https://zapier.com/blog/two-factor-authentication-2fa-guide/#apps) (No SMS!), [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) alerts, and how to identify & deal with [ransomware](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ransomware-what-to-do-next,news-25107.html).

It may be a frustrating conversation, but dealing with ransomeware & identity theft is way worse. I can speak from experience.
