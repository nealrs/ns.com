Do hackathons belong on your résumé? Yes, without a doubt! While it's not _professional_ experience, a hackathon project represents hard won lessons in project management, team work, self-education, creativity, and competition.

The hard part is figuring out how and where to include it on your résumé.

My advice is to create a seperate section for hackathons, below your work experience. Include 2&ndash;3 relevant hackathon projects and briefly explain what you built, your contributions, any wins or recognition, and link to the Devpost page or demo.

BTW, hackathons are a great source of material when answering those "tell me about a time when&hellip;" behavioral interview questions.
