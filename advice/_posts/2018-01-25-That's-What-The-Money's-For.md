Unsatisfied with your paycheck? [Tom Lianza's advice](https://lianza.org/blog/2018/01/21/fellow-engineers-this-is-where-your-money-comes-from/) is to look for ways to add value to whatever makes your business money: customers.

I agree. And I like how it encourages developers to consider & engage with other disciplines & people within their business.

However, Tom does not address how to _leverage_ that added value for your own benefit.

**If you want to get paid more, document your accomplishments & added value and then initiate a conversation with your manager about compensation.**

That might sound uncomfortable, but your manager is neither a mind reader, nor your best friend. You must take an active role in your own career and assert what you want!

BTW, if your boss reminds you of Don Draper circa season 4, it might be time to move on.
